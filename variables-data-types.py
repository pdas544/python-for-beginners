Variables: 
- Variables in Python are used to store data values. 
- A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. 
- Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to declare the type of a variable when you create one. 
- The type is inferred from the value you assign to the variable. For example:

x = 5       # x is of type integer
y = "Hello" # y is of type text (aka string)

Variables can change type after they have been set. For example:

x = 4       # x is initially an integer
x = "Four"  # x is now a string

Python variable names are case-sensitive and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but they must start with a letter or an underscore.

For eg: 
lx = 5 # correct
_x = 10 #correct
3x = 15 # incorrect variable name 3x, must start with a letter
