Introduction to Data Structures in Python:

1. List
2. Tuple
3. Set
4. Dictionary


We can perform various operations on these data structures, such as:
- Adding elements
- Removing elements
- Accessing elements
- Modifying elements
- Iterating through elements
- Sorting elements



List: A dynamic array that can grow or shrink in size. It allows duplicate elements and is mutable.

Tuple: Similar to a list but immutable, meaning its elements cannot be changed after creation.

Set: A collection of unique elements. It is unordered and mutable.

Dictionary: A collection of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique, and values can be updated.

String: Treated as a sequence of characters. Strings are immutable and support slicing and indexing.
